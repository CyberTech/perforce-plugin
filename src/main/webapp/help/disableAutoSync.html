    <b>Disable Auto Sync</b>: allows you to tell this plugin to not sync a workspace
    before the build begins. Changeset retrieval will also be disabled. Default behavior is to sync to the head revision.
  </p>
<p>This option can also be controlled at build time by creating a boolean parameter on the build called "P4DISABLESYNC".</p>
